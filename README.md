# Mocket - AI-Powered Mock API Platform

*Mocket: Generate, Test, and Simulate APIs Effortlessly.*

## 🚀 Overview

Mocket is an **AI-powered mock API platform** designed to help developers test and simulate APIs efficiently without relying on a fully developed backend. It eliminates backend dependency by providing an intuitive way to create dynamic APIs, automate responses, and streamline frontend development.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **AI-Generated Mock APIs** – Instantly create realistic API endpoints with minimal effort.
- **Dynamic Responses** –  Generate dynamic responses based on types.
- **Visual Workflow Builder** – Create complex logic for API responses using an intuitive, no-code workflow editor.
- **Advanced API Testing** – Simulate latency, inject failures, and test real-world scenarios without modifying the backend.
- **Stateful Mocking (Planned)** – Maintain request states for more accurate testing.
- **Web Extension for API Interception (Planned)** – Modify API responses in real-time directly from the browser.
- **Seamless Integration** – Works with REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets, making it a versatile tool for developers.
